19cld0z,My Thoughts on EcZachly/Zach Wilson's Bootcamp V.3,"I was already hovering over [Zach's Bootcamp](https://dataexpert.io/) but was a bit insecure since the price was huge and a few not many positive comments on two posts from this subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/14ieh8u/any_feedback_on_zach_wilsons_data_engineering/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/12otxy6/interview_prep_anyone_in_zach_wilsons_data/). So I have seen the posting about a PPP discount based on the country that you live in, since Brazil's economy is kinda crap, I decided to try, if I got I would buy, otherwise maybe think a bit more and try on another opportunity. To my surprise, I was selected! Now I will give you guys my feedback for all the weeks since I got the both tracks course.

It's important to notice that I have been a Data Engineer for almost 2 years, but never worked on big tech, FAANG, etc. meh experiences, not complete garbage but nothing mind-blowing, know a bit of Scala, worked with Airflow, PySpark, Cloud, Pandas... The classic stuff.

TLDR: Was worth it? Yes. Further, I will point out a few things that made it worth it. Just the knowledge may not be worth it for you.

Week 1 - Dimensional Data Modeling

This first week, I believe Zach was extremely motivated to teach, the classes were insightful and focused on data engineering basis, there I fixated on the differences between OLTP and OLAP, and also learned about the existence of Master Data.

There he points out a lot about **how** you are delivering your data, and the importance of noticing that for each kind of consumer, you may want to prepare the data in different ways.

Learned about additivity on the dimensions, a term that I had never heard before the boot camp, and also about SCD tables, I don't know why, but never heard about this one before too.

Week 2 - Fact Data Modeling

This second week Zach was also extremely motivated, I believe these two topics are his favorite, not that he wasn't motivated on the others, but the difference between Week 1 and 2, and the rest was clear. There I also fixated on the difference between a fact and a dimension.

During this week Zach taught about techniques for fact tables deduplication, and ways to aggregate fact data into lists or binaries format to get fast analytics.

It's good to point out that Zach brings a lot of his experience to FAANG-like companies, so some cases will not apply to you probably, but it is nice to know how happens there, this extends to the whole boot camp.

Week 3 - Analytics Track - Analytical Patterns

Here Zach taught about what kind of patterns to aggregate data would suit better for each type of requirement, for example, what to use when we are looking for root causes, what to use when looking for rankings, etc.

One insightful class from this week was related to the data engineering interview process (usually on big techs), he told me about what to expect in terms of technical tests, what to pay attention to during the coding interview, tips and tricks for window functions, and there I learned also a new thing that never seen before GROUPING SETS, GROUP BY CUBE and GROUP BY ROLLUP.

Week 3 - Infrastructure Track - Flink Streaming

I hated this week, not by Zach's fault, but I didn't like streaming, I think it was good knowledge, but certainly not enough time for someone who has never seen that before. I believe that for people like me that never used or seen Flink before, I was only able to digest and understand the theoretical part, like Kappa and Lambda architecture, or the concepts of micro-batch and near real-time, etc.

During the labs, we used Flink with Kafka, I have never used both of them, but tbh, I was warned, he says on the requirements sections that for infrastructure track: ""Basic understanding of Docker, Flink, and Kafka."" So if you want to do the boot camp, try to look just a bit to understand, it will make your life easier.

I discovered that maybe I don't want to work on Uber lol

Week 4 - Analytics Track - KPIs and Experimentation

This week Zach taught about leading and lagging metrics, another concept that I have never heard before, and also [Timothy Chan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trchan/) taught about A/B tests, experimentation, etc. Tim is a nice guy, but the content for me, was boring.

Week 4 - Infrastructure Track - Spark Batch

Here was one of the most awaited weeks, here Zach covered topics from the basics of Spark theory, so what is a plan, driver, and executor, to JOIN optimizations and tuning. We have seen differences from the caching and broadcasting, as well as Notebooks x Spark Submit. It was nice but maybe expecting something different.

Week 5 - Analytics Track - Data Quality

Here I can summarize that it was related to the importance of trust in data, and what kind of data quality checks we can use for different cases and each type of table. I used my notion annotations from this class as a cheat sheet to check if I am not missing any type of QA check. Interesting to point out to you guys that he mentioned an Airbnb framework called MIDAS, google it when you have time.

The second class was presented by a Brazilian fellow that is specialized in dbt, it was interesting, of course, have heard about dbt but never had the opportunity to try it.

Also here we learned about data design document building, and I liked it.

Week 5 - Infrastructure Track - Also Data Quality

This week wasn't anything mind-blowing, but was important, here we discussed about differences between SE testing and DE testing, why they have higher quality standards, why most organizations miss the mark

In the second part of this week, the Airflow God [Marc Lamberti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marclamberti/) caught the reins and gave us a presentation on the theory of data contracts, best practices on data validation, and ways to enhance the data quality, followed by the technical part using Airflow.

Week 6 - Analytics Track - Visual Impact

Here we had a class where the knowledge there was insightful but not useful for me yet, he discussed challenges and what separates the senior data engineer from the staff data engineer, as a few career insights more related to professionals in higher places of the hierarchy, so not absorbed much in my POV, since I am still kinda a minion.

The theory behind Dataviz was taught here, it would be like maybe the Week 3 classes being used in real life, very insightful, for those who are looking for analytics engineering, this week is a must.

Week 6 - Infrastructure Track - Pipeline Maintenance

This one was maybe even harder to digest than the Flink one for a reason, I never had to schedule maintenance on pipelines, reduce costs, or optimize computing on pipelines yet. This kind of stuff is out of my decision power, so great content, but not applicable to me. He taught about the impact of ownership on projects, the significance of domain knowledge, and effective communication. Another example that he talks about is related to tech debt and data migration, so yeah, I have never had to deal with that, so kind of abstract for me.

I have to point out a few things about this boot camp:

1. I thought the weekly homework would be easy peasy, Udemy quiz-like. I couldn't be more wrong. They are hard and require a lot of time. If you don't mind about the certification and the mentorship program, you don't need to worry about that.
2. Zach has a discord community for those who are in his boot camp, there you can chat with your peers, Zach, and people from other boot camps, it's nice and helps keep the engagement.
3. With the boot camp, you gain access to past classes and talks from people who have been there, so you can watch for example the [Joe Reis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephreis/) talk that happened during V3 boot camp.
4. Weekly is a Career Development Q&A with [Sarah Floris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-floris/), we can ask questions, tips for LinkedIn, etc.
5. For those who do the homework on time, we have access to a weekly coffee chat with Zach, where we can ask questions for him. Extremely worth it, that was what motivated me the most for doing homework, I could participate in all of them, and it was nice to be on the last one, because the first one had like 80 people, and the last maybe 8, so only the warriors were there.
6. Access to other classes like LLM-related or 30-minute classes to prepare for technical interviews, like data architecture, data modeling, SQL, and DSA.
7. In the end, we have a capstone project that we developed by ourselves with a few requirements, fetching all the knowledge, it is a good idea, but this one was too much for me, the due date is on Jan 26th, but I will not be able to finish it, marriage ceremony preparation, masters and other life things are draining too much time for me to dive into that, but I would recommend doing that.

With those points above I feel that was worth it, it was intense, but I feel grateful for the knowledge. As I said before if you are already a data engineer master, that is the data modeling king, and all the topics that I mentioned you are comfortable with, or at least with most of them, maybe it will not be worth it for you, this boot camp is more suited for someone that already know something, but still need to climb the ladder, so maybe an end junior\~end mid-level range.

For the V.4 boot camp, Zach removed from the curricula the pipeline maintenance and dataviz week, but it will be available from my cohort and will be adding a dbt week and an end-to-end Machine Learning week though, to be honest, I am not a big fan of ML and didn't fall in love with dbt, so I would prefer doing my version lol, but I am sure that it will be cool too.

I am sure that on many points Zach is improving the UX of his boot camp, so things that were bad from the V.2 were better on V.3 and the V.4 will be better than mine. I conclude with if you can, do it, but be prepared to dedicate 6 weeks to that, just watching the recorded classes is a waste of an opportunity.

If you guys have any other questions about the boot camp I am glad to answer them, I know that it is not cheap and you may feel insecure, you can ask here or reach me on DM.",20,49,abbadb,2024-01-22 02:51:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/19cld0z/my_thoughts_on_eczachlyzach_wilsons_bootcamp_v3/,False,False,False,False

2. If its a SaaS tool, are u willing to pay for it ?
3. How much? Assuming monthly bill.

19cyd9g,Where’s the boundary between “the added complexity doesnt outweigh the benefit” and “scalability?”,"I see arguments from time to time that it’s fine going straight into using spark, airflow, highly available rdbms, advanced git vc architectures, CI/CD, kubernetes, or whatever. The argument is typically that the designer expects the business to need to go this route eventually, and why design a system that you know you’ll have to redesign later on for scalability reasons?

Then there’s the other argument that these systems are completely unnecessary for small time guys, despite the fact that they offer many unique quality-of-life features that aren’t replicated elsewhere. The complexity of these systems alone seems to warrant a need for implementation, and if that need isn’t satisfied them it’s considered an unnecessary effort. Resume driven development.

So where’s the line between these perspectives? Does it depend on team size and knowledge? What else?",11,8,DuckDatum,2024-01-22 15:37:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/19cyd9g/wheres_the_boundary_between_the_added_complexity/,False,False,False,False
19cxuav,Am I too fussy?,"Hi guys! seeking some advice on my data engineering career.

19cukvp,"How do you manage the amount of data ""assets"" in your business?","I've been wondering recently just how much of a problem this really is.

To run a data engineering department, you have, in some capacity, all of the following:  
\- source data (API's, files, external DB tables)  
\- storage (blobs, databases, lakehouses, more files)  
\- pipelines (code, no-code, low-code  
\- dashboards (customer facing, internal, observability) 

All of these exist across different codebases/repositories, tools, teams, software.

How the hell do you manage all of it?

Sure, you can say ""documentation"", but even in the best case, you have a Confluence that has the documentation which explains everything, a README in the Git repo, but it still does little to explain everything that you own and how it all links together, short of a few diagrams that are likely outdated.

Does anybody do this in what they would consider a ""good"" way? Or even any way at all that isn't just documentation?

We're looking into OpenMetadata as a tool to help with some of this on a more granular level, but it still doesn't answer it at the scale I'm talking about.",5,4,theDro54,2024-01-22 12:30:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/19cukvp/how_do_you_manage_the_amount_of_data_assets_in/,False,False,False,False

19cvtuu,Advice on data infrastructure,"Hello! I'm trying to set up a new infrastructure for data in my organization. I'm not a data engineer, but I'm trying to understand the problem and look for the best solutions. I wanted to ask you for some advice:

I need to extract data from a source (using Airbyte), place this data in a warehouse (using Clickhouse), transform this data to generate better visualizations (dbt) and eventually visualize this data (Metabase).

I wanted to know if this makes sense. My focus is open source tools, which I can deploy locally and manage, hence the tools mentioned.

After that, I would also like to be able to perform some actions on this data. For example, using Retool or some tool that allows me to perform actions to insert data into my data. So I don't know exactly how to proceed.

I can connect Retool directly to my warehouse and perform actions with the data there, inserting new rows that represent other information linked to some table (for example, a users table), but I understand that this would not be the best way to proceed.

I know that there are ""Reverse ETLs"", which took the data from the warehouse and placed it elsewhere, for example in Retool itself. But, how (preferably using some tool) can I insert new lines of information into my data using this architecture?

I thought that Reverse ETL could connect to Postgres, replicate the data that I think is relevant from the warehouse, then Retool connects to that Postgres and eventually performs data insertions in that database, then Airbyte ingests the data again, doing rewrite of the old data. That makes sense?

Any information, advice or help would be great!

# University Reddit Data Dashboard

The University Reddit Data Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key statistics from the university's subreddit, encompassing both posts and comments over the past week. It features an in-depth analysis of sentiments expressed in these posts, comments, and by the authors themselves, all tracked and evaluated over the same seven-day period.

## Features

The project is entirely hosted on the Google Cloud Platform and is ***horizontal scalable***. The scraping workload is evenly distributed across the computer engines(VM). Data manipulation is done through the Spark cluster(Google dataproc), where by increasing the worker node, the workload will be distributed across and finished more quickly.

## Project Structure

19carxy,Feedback on an Event Based Automation System?,"Hello,

I'm currently working on developing email notifications for impending software license expirations within our organization. I'm adopting an event-based automation approach. The architecture I've proposed would use existing instances of Prefect and Postgres, while introducing Redis and Celery as an intermediary to allow Postgres to communicate with Prefect.

The automations are handled via a Postgres `jobs` table. INSERT instigates a NOTIFY which Redis accepts as a PUBLISHER. This propagates to Celery passing along information to the Prefect API.

The job will include details about the deployment to run and the parameters to pass into the deployment. So Redis and Celery are not stuck to any single automation. Furthermore, Celery would query the Prefect API for updates on the Flow Runs status and update the `jobs` table respectively.

The linked architecture (https://imgur.com/a/H5kC6wE) is designed to prevent the creation of isolated solutions for every issue as the code base evolves and matures, avoiding a complex and convoluted long run. I’m hoping this approach to email notifications is not too complicated while offering a much higher benefit. I'd appreciate feedback on this approach.

Our capabilities are limited digitally and it’s in the organizations interest right now to improve our “data platform,” so to speak. So I don’t necessarily see this as an unnecessary effort.

19caao0,Designing a data workflow for a small company,"I work at a company with eight employees, and was recently hired as a data/business analyst. The company uses an in-house software to manage online retail sales. There is a huge amount of data available, and I need to design a workflow to capture sales data and business analytics. Currently, most of the company’s data is stored in a combination of a MySQL database and DynamoDB.

I would like to design a workflow that queries one or both of these databases to record daily statistics (i.e. sales of groups of products over time), cleans the data, and records it in a new “analytics” database. This new data would then be easier to handle for visualization, modeling, etc.

Currently I’m taking a course in AWS Lambda, because it seems like that’s the best way to go to automate my scripts. I’m looking into relational database and NoSQL models, and am leaning towards the latter but I’m unsure.

Does anyone have advice on this workflow, ideas on where to start, or resources to consult? This is my first job in the field, so I really appreciate any advice!

19cwnqx,Passing from Junior analyst in Big 4 toward an internship in a bank,"I don't know if it is worth the sho. osition in a major investment bank but it's a 9-month internship where I don't know if there could be a possibility to have a full-time position. Some pros is that is abroad, far from my country and this is something I like to do while cons, the major one is to leave a position where I'll become senior next year.  


also, the position will be slightly oriented on risk with quantitative applications while atm I'm a data engineer. The good news is the possibility to move to other teams once inside the company.

19cru8f,Learning DataEng Question/Advice,"Hi all,

Apologies if this is not the correct place to ask this question. I have started the dataTalks data eng zoomcamp which I am enjoying. I am a BI/SQL person in my current role (2 years) and I'm keen to transition into data eng so I have been considering portfolio ideas.

What I would like to do is to ingest spotify data into a database and have this take place automatically, perhaps once per day/week. I would then connect to that DB using PowerBI to develop a dashboard. I would like all of this to take place in the cloud so that the ingestion takes place without any reliance on my local machine being turned on or connected to the internet all the time.

Is this a realistic? If so where would you suggest I start?

I don't have much data eng knowledge yet but I have recently learned how to spin up a VM on google cloud, run docker containers/networks with postgres/pgadmin and I have also written a python script to ingest data into the postgres DB by grabbing a CSV from a website.

19c99y5,"Created a pipeline ingesting data via kafka, processing via akka streams in Scala and moving it to Snowflake","This is one of the projects I have created to learn how to work with real time data and understand how to connect to cloud storage and use snowflake features.

**About the project**:

1. Yelp dataset containing business data across is produced to kafka.
2. Real time data then is consumed from kafka via alpakka connector and transformed using akka streams with Scala.
3. Data is moved to mongo DB and also to azure data lake storage gen2 gin multiple files.
4. Once the data is there in ADLS, snowpipe is configured to moved that data to Snowflake.
5. Snowflake script is present in the /conf folder of the repo.

Github URL :  [https://github.com/sarthak2897/business-insights](https://github.com/sarthak2897/business-insights)

Technologies used : Kafka,Scala, Akka streams, Mongo DB,Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Snowflake

Please provide feedback on how I can improve and modify the pipeline. Thanks!
