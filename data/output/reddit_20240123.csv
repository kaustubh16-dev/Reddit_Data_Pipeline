19d6f86,First time connecting to an API,"Backstory - First let me say Iâ€™m a newish BI analyst and in a department of me. We are starting to develop a data culture but I need to show value. Iâ€™m using PBI and made several reports from on prem databases. 

My goal is to connect to an API and put the acquired data into a MS Access database. The API returns the data in JSON format. 

Iâ€™ve written a very simple Python program that pulls the data from the API on a daily basis and places it in a JSON file to be consumed by PBI. 

Iâ€™m not a data engineer by any stretch of the imagination but I figured this would be the right sub to ask this question. 

Is it possible for Python to pull the data from the API and insert into an Access database while also performing some ETL?

19dry3i,What do you think about Apache Pulsar?,"Pulsar is a robust data streaming and messaging platform, similar to Kafka, but with more features out-of-the-box like schema-registry, multi-tenancy, geo-replication, and tiered storage.

It has been an Apache top-level project since 2018 ([https://pulsar.apache.org](https://pulsar.apache.org/)). Many big companies like Tencent, Discord, Flipkart, and Intuit use it.

Unlike Kafka, it processes messages individually, instead of just using offsets. Horizontal scaling is painless in comparison with Kafka, thanks to the separation of compute and storage nodes. Supports millions of topics.

When I first heard about the Pulsar, I thought my dreams had come true. ðŸŒˆðŸ¦„

Now I'm trying to understand why there is not much buzz in public about it:

* Is it a marketing flaw and people just didn't ever hear about it?
* Or is there something wrong or missing in Pulsar?

19dtqiu,DBT for On-Prem ETL,"So, to provide some background, I currently run a very small data team in an industry thatâ€™s heavily biased towards on-prem. After facing some limitations with SSIS, weâ€™re looking to move to a more modern ETL solution. My issue is we are currently built to run on-prem ETL while modern architecture seems to focus cloud ELT.

My current setup is as follows: 
1. Extract data from a variety of structured SQL servers (most on-prem, some accessed through VPN. All have direct SQL access)
2. Transform that data using SQL into a more usable, de-normalized format
3. Upload the data into our on-prem data warehouse for analytics. 

A few complicating factors:
1. Several of our vendors are moving to the cloud and Iâ€™ll need to export the data via API (and one vendor through snowflake)
2. Our largest data table is under 30 million rows, I donâ€™t expect I need anything more complicated than polars/pandas and SQL
3. In the future, weâ€™d like to be able to ingest and process high frequency (~5-15s) data loaded via 1 hour batches. I donâ€™t need streaming yet nor do I want to implement it. 

Tools Iâ€™ve considered:
Mage*
Dagster
Airflow
Pandas/Polars*
DuckDB
DBT*
Minio*

*Current favorite for that role


My thought is, if Iâ€™m rebuilding this anyway, would it make more sense to move to an ELT architecture with DBT or maintain my ETL architecture with Python/SQL. What would that look like? Load everything raw into parquet files and process from there? Load raw data into intermediate tables on the same server as the data warehouse? If the majority of my data is already structured, should I bother with parquet? I apologize for the deluge of questions, Iâ€™m trying to wrap my head around this new world order after spending too long in the comfortable embrace of SSIS.

19dtn2u,How to do design a near real-time data job,"I need to create a python app that will output data e.g. every 5s (ideally should be parametrizable to e.g. 10s or 1 day). Input is realtime data stream from RabbitMQ/Kafka. Every 5s app should look into the queue and take all data between defined start and end time - i.e. every run instance should be idempotent as it is defined by static start/end. Job should have some retrying logic in case something fails. App should run in on-premise Kubernetes cluster.

I thought of 3 possible solutions:

a) custom python app with some scheduler such as Airflow that could schedule the app in cluster every 5s

b) custom python app that would run in an infinite loop as standalone pod in the cluster and every 5s or so would do the job

c) use some existing solution that would solve both issues (data logic and scheduling) for me

The issue with a) is we need a robust scheduler that could handle all the job spawns (each 5s, each 10s etc.)

The issue with b) is there is less transparency in case app crashes and also since its only one app in case it crashes all runs that should run after the crash won't run until the app is fixed (scheduler would schedule all the following runs despite previous fails)

The issue with c) is the only potential solution is Prefect but it has memory leak so when we run it for inifity it will eventually run out of memory.

I've graduated my bachelor and decided to put my time in Data Engineering cause it seems more interesting than other fields. I've been looking at what the fundamentals are and if I understand correctly I should focus on getting to an advanced level on Python and SQL first before moving to some suite of tools to build my first solo-project to demonstrate I can actually be of use to a company.

* Get a back-end developer job in my vicinity as quick as possible, even if it is not Data Engineering related, just to get some experience on my resume and not look like a complete beginner to future DE recruiters; i would study on a portion of my free time.
* Not get a job and just spend my days studying DE and making that project to get good quicker than the first option; I don't know how long that would take and if being unemployed for that amount of time would look very bad on my resume.

19dt9fn,How to model and save these two data source.,"In a manufactoring project I have two sensors:

1. Sensor 1: temperature data sampled at 10Hz continously.
2. Sensor 2: 3-axis accelerometer data sampled at 6kHz in a window of 10s every 10m. In other words, every 10m I have a windows of 10s containing 10\*6k=60000 records. Every record has a timestamp, a value for axis x, y, and z. 60000x4 table.

On sensors 2 data:

The ideas is to perform, at some stage, a ""data engineering"" phase where the ""raw data"" from sensors 2 mentionted before are processed in order to output some informative and less-dimensional data. For instance, letting the inputs be:

* Window 1 of 10s, sampled at 6kHz, every 10m has 60000x4 data (timestamp, x, y, z).
* Window 2 of 10s, sampled at 6kHz, every 10m has 60000x4 data (timestamp, x, y, z).
* ...
* Window M: ...

The output would be:

* MxN table/matrix (windows\_id, timestamp\_start\_window, feature1, feature2, ..., feature N-2).

Where N is the number of synthetic features created (e.g. mean x, median y, max z, min z, etc..) plus a timestamp (for instance the start of the window) and the windows ID and M is the number of windows.

If I want to save these two data raw sources (inputs) into a file system or database, and also the synthetic data (outputs), how would you save them in order to be flexible and efficient with later data analysis? The analysis will be based on time-series algorithm in order to dedect patterns and anomaly detections.

Note, the two sensors are an example of different sources with different requirements but the use case is not ""that simple"". I would like to discuss the design of modeling and storing/extraction of these time-series with easiness, scaling, and efficiency in mind.

I was asked how do I monitor the data pipelines and ensure its accuracy. My response was, I enjoy working with the end user and am really great about getting constant feedback. I said how in my current role, as a Product Engineer, i spend a lot of time with users and going through user data/feedback to determine the success of a feature. 

Now that I'm thinking about it -- they may have been asking me what tools I use.

Earlier, I described a FastAPI poller I built that detected any new data from an AWS EC2 where I dumped everything. Then it took the new data, transformed it in into the ""pretty"" staging structures then updated the appropriate (separate) EC2 tables. In this case, I use pydantic models to ensure that the data is structured correctly. Any issues I can see in the logs.

19dmods,How to handle one to many relationships in tables in a dashboard?,"Like for example, you have two tables - Orders and products. 
Orders table contains - user_id, product_id, num_orders, and 
Products table contains - product_id, product_category. 

Now, one product can belong to multiple categories. So one entry in order table might get mapped to multiple entries in products table which leads to data duplicity. Like, total orders per category or per user might be misleading.

What are the ways to handle this?",0,8,divyaanshDev,2024-01-23 11:49:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/19dmods/how_to_handle_one_to_many_relationships_in_tables/,False,False,False,False

Weâ€™ve helped hundreds privately and thousands in total to get a role in the data space. We work with staffing agencies, companies, and deal with thousands of apps getting sent out every month. Today, I want to share that inside view in hopes that someone can benefit from it.
